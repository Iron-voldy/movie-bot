class AffectedHistory(TLObject):  # type: ignore
    """Affected part of communication history with the user or in a chat.

    Constructor of :obj:`~hydrogram.raw.base.messages.AffectedHistory`.

    Details:
        - Layer: ``181``
        - ID: ``B45C69D1``

    Parameters:
        pts (``int`` ``32-bit``):
            Number of events occurred in a text box

        pts_count (``int`` ``32-bit``):
            Number of affected events

        offset (``int`` ``32-bit``):
            If a parameter contains positive value, it is necessary to repeat the method call using the given value; during the proceeding of all the history the value itself shall gradually decrease

    Functions:
        This object can be returned by 7 functions.
